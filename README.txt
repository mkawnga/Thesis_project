The percentages are based on a project on the phenotypical prediction performed on the genomic data acquired from the participants of the Genetic Risk and Outcome of Psychosis (GROUP) study.
The study has been conducted by a consortium consisting of four university psychiatric centers and their affiliated mental health care institutions in the Netherlands (University Medical Center Utrecht; University Medical Centre University of Amsterdam; Maastricht University Medical Centre; University Medical Centre Groningen). 
Thirty-six mental health care institutions participated in the study, covering a total of 75% of the Dutch population (Korver et al., 2012).
Acquired genomic data underwent a stringent SNP level QC using PLINK 1.90b3.44.
Final data set resulted in a total of 2505 individuals and 275021 SNPs.
